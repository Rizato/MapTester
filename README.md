# MOBA

This is a MOBA built to work with an existing game client. 

Check out the [wyvernrpg subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/wyvernrpg) for info about the original game. 

Check the side bar for links to the game client and such.

because the entire protocol is documented, along with permission to use the art assets, [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20101121021755/http://cabochon.com/wiz/clients) and [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20101121031823/http://cabochon.com/wiz/client_protocol)
